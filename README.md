# Cplus-plus-program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.?
This program is designed to teach high school students to develop the concepts of fiscal responsibilities via an interactive systemâ€”the program focus on investing and the power of compound interest. The student will use the program to see how their investment will grow over time.
What did you do particularly well?
As required by the client, I used OOP, the flow of the program is easy to navigate and to have quick feedback. The program with the while loop allow the user to modify their entries. I also used a try ...catch block to handle an exception if the user enters a negative number.
Where could you enhance your code? 
The output format is not what I  would like. I need to round to two decimals all my calculations. I also will like to put less code in the main() function and free the memory from the object I created at the end of the program. This will make my program more efficient for the user and more readable for any developer.
How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I was wondering how to create multiple objects in my while loop to allow the user to have multiple trials to see how his investment can grow in the future. I realized that I can do it just with the only one object I created by rereading the submodule on the constructors, accessors, and mutators. I also discovered how to code press Enter to continue on a  youtube video. 
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The methods printSummary() and printMonthlyDetail() could be used in another project to compute the compound interest as well as the class investment.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
The use of OOP concepts helps to maintain the program. I can go back to modify each function
